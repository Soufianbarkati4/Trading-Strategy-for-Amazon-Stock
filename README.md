# Financial Analysis and Machine Learning-Based Trading Strategy for Amazon Stock

*Project Overview:*

This project comprises two main components:

- Financial Data Analysis and Visualization: A deep dive into financial data using visualization and statistical analysis techniques to identify trends, anomalies, and patterns in historical stock data.
  
- Machine Learning-Based Trading Strategy for Amazon Stock: Leveraging machine learning classification models to develop a trading strategy specifically for Amazon stock, with backtesting to assess the strategyâ€™s performance on historical data. Together, these notebooks provide a comprehensive approach to analyzing stock data and implementing predictive strategies for trading.

*Project Structure :*

- Data Collection: Loads financial data for analysis and model training. Uses reliable data sources to fetch Amazon stock prices.
  
- Data Processing and Feature Engineering: Prepares data by cleaning, structuring, and generating relevant technical indicators for predictive modeling.
  
- Visualization and Insights: Comprehensive data visualization to highlight patterns, trends, and anomalies.
  
- Model Training and Backtesting: Trains machine learning models to classify trading signals and backtests the strategy to evaluate its effectiveness.
